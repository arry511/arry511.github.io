      <description>Biography I&amp;rsquo;m a Fullstack System design engineer. I work on things related to electronics, such as circuit designing, digital designing, verilog coding, designing products which can house these beautiful electronics.. yeah that&amp;rsquo;s what I do as professional. As a hobbbyist I do much more than these things. As we all know necessity is the mother of invention, I strongly believe that we engineers are here to solve the real life problems not to create one.</description>

      <description> A Free workshop on Open source electronics - 21 July 2019 I conducted a workshop on open source electronics to 11th standard students at my almamater Viveka Pre University College, Kota, Udupi. The response was very good, students started giving life to their innovative ideas with the help of arduino microcontroller. Some even won awards at project exhibition competitions organised by nearby engineering colleges.
